This is an experimental `ContainerType`/`ScreenHandlerType`-based replacement for `fabric-containers-v0`. Fab Labs projects are typically experimental API drafts that will eventually be PR'd into [Fabric API](https://github.com/fabricmc/fabric). As such, this project is structured around Fabric API, along with its checkstyles and versioning system.
